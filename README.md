# Etch-A-Sketch
The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch 06/10/2022

For this project we were required to create a website containing HTML, CSS and Javascript where you have a canvas size
draw using javascript then when you mouse over a pixel on the canvas it colors the pixel another color.

I struggled this project I had to search up many many ways to do what I wanted and even now still have a few things I need to finish to completely finish the project how I would like to such as using the slider instead of a prompt to get the canvas size and being able to use the 3 buttons to select different colors to paint with.
